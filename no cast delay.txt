Flyff Magic Skill no cast delay:
1. Find void CMover::ProcessMoveArrival( CCtrl *pObj ) by seaching for string: CMD_SetUseSkill : %s skill(%d) not found
2. Directly above that string in the location code you can find the code:
	mov     ecx, [ebp+var_E0]
	call    sub_7EF5C0
	push    0
	mov     ecx, [ebp+var_E0]
	call    sub_7F04D0
	mov     [ebp+var_F0], eax
	push    1
	mov     ecx, [ebp+var_E0]
	call    sub_7F04D0
	mov     [ebp+var_100], eax
	push    2
	mov     ecx, [ebp+var_E0]
	call    sub_7F04D0
	mov     [ebp+sutType], eax
3. That part is this part of source:
	int nSkillIdx = GetCmdParam(0);
	OBJID idTarget = (OBJID)GetCmdParam(1);
	SKILLUSETYPE sutType = (SKILLUSETYPE)GetCmdParam(2);
4. Hook the GetCmdParam() and when argument is 2, return the value 2 (SUT_QUEUEING).
5. That fools the server to think that we are already in the Action Bar (C) queue and lets us cast skills with no delay.
6. Boom.
7. Or, find the offset for the m_nCParam[3] in the player struct.
Looks like this in dissect memory: 
	1
	1
	P->0X0X0X0X
	0
	0
	CDCDCDCD (THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF m_nCParam[3])
	CDCDCDCD
	CDCDCDCD
	0
	CDCDCDCD
	CDCDCDCD
	CDCDCDCD
	CDCDCDCD
	CDCDCDCD
8. The only issue is that those values change INCREDIBLY quick and does not get set quick enough my CE.
	We would need to be either hook a frame-by-frame function to set the value (not a custom thread).
	Or, use a variable hook?
	
In worldserver it goes immediately to this on worldserver:
else if( sutType == SUT_QUEUEING )	// 스킬큐 진행중 스킬
{
#ifdef __WORLDSERVER
	nCastingTime = 0; // removes the delay for us :)
#endif
	nMotion += 2;
	dwMsg = OBJMSG_MAGICSKILL;
