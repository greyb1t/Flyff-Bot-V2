* Find all possible pointers in the memory.
* Go through all pointers and read the memory of specific offset/offsets 
  and compare them with a value that is unique to that pointer.
* Example: Flyff Local Player
	base + 0x4 = 2 (4 byte)
	base + 0x8 = 0 (4 byte)
	base + 0xC = 1 (4 byte)
	base + 0x10 = 1 (4 byte)

	The above values are unique to the local player structure, 
	and if we brute force read these offsets and compare them to those 
	values and all of them matches, we have found out local player address.
