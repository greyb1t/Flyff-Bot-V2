- Crimson Flyff Bot Prevention -
* Not doing any damage to the monster even though SendMeleeAttack is being sent to server.
* When I select an entity normally, a packet is being sent to the server containing information about selected entity.
* If the object id of the entity that was sent and the one currently selected doesn't match, they don't do any damage.
* In order to fix this I need to call the SelectEntity function myself so it gets sent to the server before killing it.

- Another Simple Explanation -
* When you selected a monster by clicking it, a packet gets sent saying you selected it.
* When you selected a monster through memory, without clicking it, no packet it being sent.
* The server sees that you never selected any monster so they prevent you from doing any damage.
